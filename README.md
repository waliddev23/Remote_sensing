# Remote_sensing

This repo contain two folders 
One folder for the project of "drough monitoring " where my goal was to extract using Google earth engine api in colob to extract indices using landast imagery thé indices are VCI , VHI , NDVI , TCI and LST and then i combine these to do a full analysis of drough in the région of Marakech Safi in morcco 
The second project IS small notebook where the goald is to search for potential gold minerlas, both projects serve as a good introduction to remote sensing and hyperspectral images data , offereing an insight on the application of remote sensing in multiple domains
